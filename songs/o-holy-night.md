O holy night! The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

   Fall on your knees
   Oh hear the angels voices
   O night divine
   O night when Christ was born
   O night divine
   O night, O night divine

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother
And in his name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name

   Christ is the Lord!
   Oh praise his name forever
   His power and glory
   Evermore proclaim
   His power and glory
   Evermore proclaim!

   O night divine
   O night, O night divine
