He became sin, who knew no sin
That we might become His righteousness
He humbled Himself and carried the cross

Love so amazing, love so amazing

Jesus Messiah
Name above all names
Blessed Redeemer
Emmanuel
The rescue for sinners
The ransom from heaven
Jesus Messiah
Lord of all

His body, the bread
His blood, the wine
Broken and poured out, all for love
The whole earth trembled
And the veil was torn

Love so amazing, love so amazing

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

All our hope is in You
All our hope is in You
All the glory to You, God
The light of the world
