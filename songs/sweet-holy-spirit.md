There's a sweet, sweet spirit in this place
And I know that it's the Spirit of the Lord
There are sweet expressions on each face
And I know they feel the presence of the Lord

Sweet Holy Spirit, sweet heavenly dove
Stay right here with us, filling us with Your love

And for these blessings
We lift our hearts in praise
Without a doubt we'll know
That we have been revived
When we shall leave this place
