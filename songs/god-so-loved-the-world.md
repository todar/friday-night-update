<strong>(John 3:16-17)</strong>
God so loved the world
That He gave His only begotten Son
That whoever believes in Him
Shall have everlasting life

God so loved the world
That He gave His only begotten Son
That whoever believes in Him
Shall never die
Shall never, never die

For God didn't send His Son
Into the world to condemn the world
But that the world, through Him
Might be saved

God so loved the world
That He gave His only begotten Son
That whoever believes in Him
Shall have everlasting life

God so loved the world
That He gave His only begotten Son
That whoever believes in Him
Shall never die
Shall never die
But have everlasting life
