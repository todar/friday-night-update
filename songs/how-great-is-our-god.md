The splendor of a King
Clothed in majesty
Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice
He wraps Himself in light
And darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His voice, trembles at His voice

How great is our God!   Sing with me
How great is our God!   And all will see
How great, how great is our God!

Age to age He stands
And time is in His hands
Beginning and the End, Beginning and the End
The Godhead, Three in One:
Father, Spirit, Son
The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

Name above all names
Worthy of all praise
My heart will sing, "How great is our God!"

Then sings my soul
My Savior God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
