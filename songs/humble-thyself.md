 ** (James 4:10)**

*\[men lead, ladies echo]*


Humble thyself in the sight of the Lord
Humble thyself in the sight of the Lord
And He will lift you up
Higher and higher
And He will lift you up        *\[repeat]*

Humble thyself in the sight of the Lord
Humble thyself in the sight of the Lord
And He will lift you up
Higher and higher
And He will lift you up
Up into heaven
And He will lift you up
