Years I spent in vanity and pride
Caring not my Lord was crucified
Knowing not it was for me He died
On Calvary

By God's Word at last my sin I learned
Then I trembled at the law I'd spurned
Till my guilty soul imploring turned
To Calvary

<strong>Mercy there was great and grace was free
Pardon there was multiplied to me
There my burdened soul found liberty
At Calvary</strong>

Now I've giv'n to Jesus ev'rything
Now I gladly own Him as my King
Now my raptured soul can only sing
Of Calvary

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

Oh, the love that drew salvation's plan!
Oh! The grace that brought it down to man!
Oh! The mighty gulf that God did span
At Calvary!

<strong>(Chorus)  2x</strong> 

At Calvary!
