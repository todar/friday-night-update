Years I spent in vanity and pride
Caring not my Lord was crucified
Knowing not it was for me He died
On Calvary

Mercy there was great and grace was free
Pardon there was multiplied to me
There my burdened soul found liberty
At Calvary

By God's Word at last my sin I learned
Then I trembled at the law I'd spurned
Till my guilty soul imploring turned
To Calvary

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

Now I've giv'n to Jesus ev'rything
Now I gladly own Him as my King
Now my raptured soul can only sing
Of Calvary

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

Oh, the love that drew salvation's plan!
Oh! The grace that brought it down to man!
Oh! The mighty gulf that God did span
At Calvary!
