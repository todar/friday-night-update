From the highest of heights
To the depths of the sea
Creation's revealing Your majesty

From the colors of fall
To the fragrance of spring
Every creature unique
In the song that it sings
All exclaiming:

Indescribable, Uncontainable
You placed the stars in the sky
And You know them by name
You are amazing, God!

All powerful, Untamable
Awestruck we fall to our knees
As we humbly proclaim
You are amazing, God!

Who has told every lightning bolt
Where it should go?
Or seen heavenly storehouses
Laden with snow?

Who imagined the sun
And gives source to its light?
Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night?
None can fathom

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

<strong>[2nd verse, last time]</strong>
Incomparable, Unchangeable
You've seen the depths of my heart
And You love me the same
You are amazing, God!
