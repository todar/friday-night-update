My Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine
For Thee all the folly of sin I resign
My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art Thou
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now

I love Thee, because Thou hast first loved me
And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree
I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now

In mansions of glory and endless delight
I'll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright
I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now
