Whom have I in heaven but You?
There is nothing on earth I desire beside You
My heart and my strength, many times they fail
But there is one truth that always will prevail

God is the strength of my heart <strong>(3x)</strong>
And my portion forever
Forever, Forever <strong>[women echo]</strong>

God is my strength
