Don't you know that Jesus died?
Raised again in three short days
Me, the one for whom He died
Far He took my sins away
So I'm living in His love
Love I've never known before
"T" – the shape of Calvary
Which reminds me, grace is free
<strong>("Glory, hallelujah!")</strong>

Now I have life eternally!
