Be it unto me according to Your Word
According to Your promises I can stand secure
Carve upon my heart the truth that sets me free
According to Your Word O Lord be it unto me

You promised Your blood will deliver
Lord, we believe it's true
You promised us joy like a river
Lord we receive it from You

These things You have spoken
And You're bringing to pass
This world's disappearing
But Your word will last

You promised to carry our sorrows
Lord, we believe it's true
You promised unending tomorrows
Lord we receive them from You

You'll be our provider
In Your word it's revealed
And by the stripes that You bore Lord
We have been healed
