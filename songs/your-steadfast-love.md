<strong>(Psalm 36:5-10)</strong>
Your steadfast love extends to the heavens
Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds
Your righteousness is like majestic mountains
And Your wisdom like the depths of the sea
And You come to me

Filling my heart with Your lovingkindness
I find my peace in the shadow of Your wing
I eat my fill of the abundance of Your household
And I drink from the streams of rejoicing
You are my king
