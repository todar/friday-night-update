Let the earth resound with songs of praise
To the Father's power and love
For the One who set each star in place
Chose to set His heart on us
To the One whose might gives victory
Yet whose mercies never cease
As the tapestry of history 
Tells the story of His grace

King immortal, faithful God
Crowned with splendor, rich in love
Let the heavens and the earth resound
With songs of praise to You

Let the earth be stilled before the sight
Of a Father's sacrifice
That revealed the depths of love divine
In the face of Jesus Christ
Through a life of full obedience
And a death in agony
He removed the rebel's punishment
And He set the prisoner free

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

Let the earth resound with songs of faith
At the wonder yet to come
When all sin and pain are put to death
And the church and Christ are one
When we stand as God's great family
And we meet the Father's gaze
And we share in His eternal joy
As we join in ceaseless praise
