Rejoice, the Lord is King!
Your Lord and King adore
Rejoice, give thanks and sing
And triumph evermore

Lift up your heart
Lift up your voice, rejoice
Again I say, rejoice!

The Lord our Savior reigns
The God of truth and love
When He had purged our stains
He took His seat above

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

His kingdom cannot fail
He rules o'er earth and heaven
The keys of death and hell
Are to our Jesus given

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

Rejoice in glorious hope
Our Lord the Judge shall come
And take His servants up
To their eternal home
