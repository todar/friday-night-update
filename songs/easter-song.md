Hear the bells ringing, they're singing
That you can be born again
Here the bells ringing, they're singing
Christ is risen from the dead

The angel up on the tombstone said
"He has risen, just as He said
Quickly now, go tell His disciples
That Jesus Christ is no longer dead!"

Joy to the world
He is risen, Hallelujah
He's risen, Hallelujah
He's risen, Hallelujah
Hallelujah!
