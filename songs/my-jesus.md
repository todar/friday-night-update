Oh, my Jesus
You have bought me with a price
  and I am yours, Lord
Oh, my Jesus
You have shed Your blood for me
Oh, how You love me, Lord!

  I choose to follow You
  Whatever others do or say
  Because someday
  I will see Your smiling face
  Receive the fullness of Your grace
  And I will worship You

\[﻿Last time]
