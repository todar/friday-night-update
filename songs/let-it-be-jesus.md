Let it be Jesus
The first name that I call
Let it be Jesus
My song inside the storm
I'll never need another

For me to live is Christ
For me to live is Christ
God, I breathe Your name
Above everything
Let it be, let it be Jesus
Let it be, let it be Jesus

Let it be Jesus
From the rising of the sun
And let it be Jesus
When all is said and done
I'll never need another
Jesus, there's no other

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

Should I ever be abandoned
Should I ever be acclaimed
Should I ever be surrounded
By the fire and the flame
There's a name I will remember
There's a name I will proclaim
Let it be, let it be Jesus
Let it be, let it be Jesus
