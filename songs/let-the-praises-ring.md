Oh Lord, my God, in You I put my trust
Oh Lord, my God, in You I put my hope
Oh Lord, my God, in You I put my trust
Oh Lord, my God, in You I put my hope

In You, In You I find my peace
In You, In You I find my strength
In You I live and move and breathe
Let everything I say and do
Be founded by my faith in You
I lift up holy hands and sing
Let the praises ring!

Oh Lord, my God, to You I give my hands
Oh Lord, my God, to You I give my feet
Oh Lord, my God, to You I give my everything
Oh Lord, my God, to You I give my life
