Jesus Christ
I think upon Your sacrifice
You became nothing
Poured out to death

Many times
I've wondered at Your gift of life
And I'm in that place once again
I'm in that place once again

 ** *Once again
  I look upon the cross where You died
  I’m humbled by Your mercy
  And I’m broken inside
  Once again I thank You
  Once again I pour out my life***

Now You are
Exalted to the highest place
King of the heavens
Where one day I'll bow

But for now
I marvel at Your saving grace
And I'm full of praise once again
I'm full of praise once again

 ** *Once again
  I look upon the cross where You died
  I’m humbled by Your mercy
  And I’m broken inside
  Once again I thank You
  Once again I pour out my life***

Thank You for the cross
Thank You for the cross
Thank You for the cross, my friend

Thank You for the cross
Thank You for the cross
Thank You for the cross, my friend

 ** *Once again
  I look upon the cross where You died
  I’m humbled by Your mercy
  And I’m broken inside
  Once again I thank You
  Once again I pour out my life***
