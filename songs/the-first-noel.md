The first "Noel" the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Noel! Noel! Noel! Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
Who hath made heaven and earth of naught
And with His blood mankind hath bought
