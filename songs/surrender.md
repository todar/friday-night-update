I'm giving You my heart
And all that is within
I lay it all down
For the sake of You my King
I'm giving You my dreams
I'm laying down my rights
I'm giving up my pride
For the promise of new life

And I surrender all to You, all to You
And I surrender all to You, all to You

I'm singing You this song
I'm waiting at the cross
For all the world holds dear
I count it all as loss
For the sake of knowing You
The glory of Your name
To know the lasting joy
Even sharing in Your pain

I surrender all
I surrender all
All to You, my precious Savior
I surrender all
