Worthy of every song
 we could ever sing
Worthy of all the praise
 we could ever bring
Worthy of every breath
 we could ever breathe
We live for You

Jesus, the Name above
 every other name
Jesus, the only One
 who could ever save
Worthy of every breath
 we could ever breathe
We live for You
We live for You

 ***Holy, there is no one like You
  There is none beside You
  Open up my eyes in wonder
  Show me who You are
  And fill me with Your heart
  And lead me in Your love
   to those around me***

And I will not be shaken
