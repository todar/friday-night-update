<strong>(Psalm 122:1)</strong>
I was glad when they said unto me
"Let us go" into Your house, O Lord
No greater joy than to be in this place
To lift my voice and sing Your praise

Here we are in Your courts we stand
With our hearts and hands upraised
Here we are, by the blood of the Lamb
By Your grace we come
And by Your grace we stand
