 ** * Jesus, You are so good
   Jesus, You are so good
   There's nothing to fear
    'cause I'm here in Your presence***

 ** * Jesus, You are so good
   Jesus, You are so, so good
   And I just want to thank You
    with every beat of my heart***

You've given me eternal life
And Your Word to light my way
You've given me Your Spirit
With new mercies every day

 ** * Jesus, You are so good
   Jesus, You are so good
   There's nothing to fear
    'cause I'm here in Your presence***

 ** * Jesus, You are so good
   Jesus, You are so, so good
   And I just want to thank You
    with every beat of my heart***

You've given me confidence
And my soul is filled with peace
For You are my provider
You supply my every need

 ** * Jesus, You are so good
   Jesus, You are so good
   There's nothing to fear
    'cause I'm here in Your presence***

 ** * Jesus, You are so good
   Jesus, You are so, so good
   And I just want to thank You
    with every beat of my heart***

You've given us our daily bread
Our manna from above
All good things are from You
Oh, there's nothing like Your love!

 ** * Jesus, You are so good
   Jesus, You are so good
   There's nothing to fear
    'cause I'm here in Your presence***

 ** * Jesus, You are so good
   Jesus, You are so, so good
   And I just want to thank You
    with every beat of my heart***

 ** * I just want to thank You
    with every beat of my heart***
