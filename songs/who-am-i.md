Who am I
that the Lord of all the earth
would care to know my name
would care to feel my hurt?

Who am I
that the bright and morning star
would choose to light the way
for my ever wandering heart?

 ***Not because of who I am
 But because of what You've done
 Not because of what I've done
 But because of who You are***

 ***I am a flower quickly fading
   Here today and gone tomorrow
   A wave tossed in the ocean
   A vapor in the wind
   Still You hear me when I'm calling
   Lord, You catch me when I'm falling
   And You've told me who I am
   I am Yours***

Who am I
that the eyes that see my sin
would look on me with love
and watch me rise again?

Who am I
that the voice that calmed the sea
would call out through the rain
and calm the storm in me?

 ***Not because of who I am
 But because of what You've done
 Not because of what I've done
 But because of who You are***

 ***I am a flower quickly fading
   Here today and gone tomorrow
   A wave tossed in the ocean
   A vapor in the wind
   Still You hear me when I'm calling
   Lord, You catch me when I'm falling
   And You've told me who I am
   I am Yours***
