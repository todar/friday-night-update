Majesty, worship His majesty
Unto Jesus be all glory, honor, and praise
Majesty, Kingdom authority
Flow from His throne
Unto His own, His anthem raise

So exalt, lift up on high the name of Jesus
Magnify, come glorify Christ Jesus the King

Majesty, worship His majesty
Jesus who died, now glorified
King of all kings
