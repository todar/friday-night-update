Your love shining like the sun
Pouring like the rain
Raging like the storm
Refreshing me again
Oooo, I receive Your love

Your grace frees me from the past
It purges ev'ry sin
It purifies my heart
And heals me from within
Oooo, I receive Your grace

Pour over me, pour over me
Let Your rain flood this thirsty soul
Pour over me, Your waves of love
Pour over me

I come and lay my burden down
Gladly, at Your feet
I'm opening up my heart
Come make this joy complete
Oooo, I receive Your peace
