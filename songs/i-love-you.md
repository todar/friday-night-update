We can be together for now and forever
I love you, I love you
And when I'm praying I hear Him saying
"I love you, I love you"
People all over the world, they're opening up
they're coming around and they're saying

I love You, I love You, I love You, I love You, I love You\
I love You
I love You, I love You, I love You, I love You, I love You\
I love You

Brother and sister, missus and mister, I love you, I love you
He made me feel it and I can't conceal it
I love you, I love you
Jesus came into the world to show us the way, to set us all free
And when He died, He was saying

I love You, I love You, I love You, I love You, I love You\
I love You\
He was saying
I love You, I love You, I love You, I love You, I love You\
I love You

We can be together for now and forever
I love you, I love you
Brother and sister, missus and mister
I love you, I love you

I love You, I love You, I love You, I love You, I love You\
I love You
I love You, I love You, I love You, I love You, I love You\
I love You
