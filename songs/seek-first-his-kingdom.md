<strong>(Matthew 6:33; Luke 12:24, 27)</strong>
Seek first His kingdom
And His righteousness
And everything that You need
God will give to You
God will give to You

Consider the ravens
They don't sow
Neither do they reap
Without storehouse or barn
But they're fed by God
What will He do for You?
If you seek…

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

Consider the lilies
They don't toil, neither do they spin
Even King Solomon
Had no clothes like these
What will God do for You?
So, seek…
