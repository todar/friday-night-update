 **  (Matthew 6:33; Luke 12:24-27)**

 ***Seek first His kingdom
 And His righteousness
 And everything that you need
 God will give to you
 God will give to you***

 ***Seek first His kingdom
 And His righteousness
 And everything that you need
 God will give to you
 God will give to you***

Consider the ravens
They don’t sow
Neither do they reap
Without storehouse or barn
But they’re fed by God
What will He do for you?
If you …

 ***Seek first His kingdom
 And His righteousness
 And everything that you need
 God will give to you
 God will give to you***

Consider the lilies
They don’t toil
Neither do they spin
Even King Solomon
Had no clothes like these
What will God do for you?
So, …

 ***Seek first His kingdom
 And His righteousness
 And everything that you need
 God will give to you
 God will give to you***

 ***And everything that you need
 God will give to you
 God will give to you***
