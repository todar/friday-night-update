Singin' a song
I'm singin' a song
I'm singin' a song to praise
 the wonderful name of Jesus
Singin' a song
C'mon sing along
Sing a song to praise
 Jesus' wonderful name

Singin' a song (ooh ooh)
We're singin' a song (ooh ooh)
We're singin' a song to praise
 the wonderful name of Jesus
Singin' a song
It's not very long
But we're singin' this song to praise
 Jesus' wonderful name

**1**  We love to sing to You
**2**  We love to worship You
**3**  We're going to lift our praise
    forevermore
**4**  We love You, Jesus
**5**  For all You've done for us
**6**  We will praise You, Lord
**7**  For all eternity
