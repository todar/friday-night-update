All my days I will sing this song of gladness
Give my praise to the Fountain of delights
For in my helplessness You heard my cry
And waves of mercy poured down on my life

I will trust in the cross of my Redeemer
I will sing of the blood that never fails
Of sins forgiven of conscience cleansed
Of death defeated and life without end

Beautiful Savior, Wonderful Counselor
Clothed in majesty, Lord of history
You're the Way, the Truth, the Life
Star of the morning, glorious in holiness
You're the Risen One, Heaven's Champion
And You reign, You reign over all

I long to be where the praise is never-ending
Yearn to dwell where the glory never fades
Where countless worshippers will share one song
And cries of "Worthy!" will honor the Lamb
