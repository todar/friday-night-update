The nails in Your hands
The nail in Your feet
They tell me how much You love me
The thorns on Your brow
They tell me how
You bore so much pain to love me

And when the heavens pass away
All Your scars will still remain
And forever they will say
Just how much You love me
So I want to say

Forever my love
Forever my heart
Forever my life is Yours
