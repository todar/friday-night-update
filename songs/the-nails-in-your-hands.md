The nails in Your hands
The nail in Your feet
They tell me how much You love me
The thorns in Your brow
They tell me how
You bore so much shame to love me

And when the heavens pass away
All Your scars will still remain
And forever they will say
Just how much You love me
So I want to say

  Forever my love
  Forever my heart
  Forever my life is Yours
  Forever my love
  Forever my heart
  Forever my life is Yours
