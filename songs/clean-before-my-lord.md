**2 Corinthians 5:17; 1 John 1:7**

  Clean before my Lord I stand
  And in me, not one blemish does He see
  When I placed all my burdens on Him
  He washed them all from me

The life that I left is past
I live new life that will last eternally
In Christ, new things have come
I rejoice in Him
I'm alive in Him

  Clean before my Lord I stand
  And in me, not one blemish does He see
  When I placed all my burdens on Him
  He washed them all from me

The life that I left is past
I live new life that will last eternally
In Christ, new things have come
I rejoice in Him
I'm alive in Him

  Clean before my Lord I stand
  And in me, not one blemish does He see
  When I placed all my burdens on Him
  He washed them all from me

  He washed them all from me
