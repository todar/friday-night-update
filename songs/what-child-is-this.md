What child is this, who, laid to rest
On Mary’s lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping

  This, this is Christ the King
  Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
  Haste, haste to bring Him laud
  The babe, the son of Mary

Why lies He in such mean estate
Where ox and mule are feeding?
Come, have no fear, God’s Son is here
His love, all loves exceeding

  Nails, spear shall pierce Him through
  The Cross be borne for me, for you
  Hail, hail the Word made flesh
  The babe, the son of Mary

So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh
Come, peasant, king, to own Him
The King of kinds salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him

  Raise, raise the song on high
  The virgin sings her lullaby
  Joy! Joy, for Christ is born
  The babe, the son of Mary
