What child is this, who, laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The babe, the son of Mary

Why lies He in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Come, have no fear, God's Son is here
His love all loves exceeding
Nails, spear shall pierce Him through
The Cross be borne for me, for you
Hail, hail the Word made flesh
The babe, the son of Mary

So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh
Come, peasant, king, to own Him
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him
Raise, raise the song on high
The virgin sings her lullaby
Joy! Joy, for Christ is born
The babe, the son of Mary
