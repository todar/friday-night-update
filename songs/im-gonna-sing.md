I'm gonna sing, sing, sing
I'm gonna shout, shout, shout
I'm gonna sing, I'm gonna shout
Praise the Lord!
When those gates are open wide
I'm gonna sit by Jesus' side
I'm gonna sing, I'm gonna shout
Praise the Lord!

Oh, when the saints go marchin' in
Oh, when the saints go marchin' in
O Lord, I want to be in that number
When the saints go marchin' in

Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
