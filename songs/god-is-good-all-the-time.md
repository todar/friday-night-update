 ** * God is good, all the time
   He put a song of praise in this heart of mine
   God is good, all the time
   Through the darkest night His light will shine
   God is good
   God is good
   All the time!***

 ** * God is good, all the time
   He put a song of praise in this heart of mine
   God is good, all the time
   Through the darkest night His light will shine
   God is good
   God is good
   All the time!***

If you're walking through the valley
And there are shadows all around
Do not fear, He will guide you
He will keep you safe and sound
He has promised to never leave you
Or forsake you, and His word is true

 ** * God is good, all the time
   He put a song of praise in this heart of mine
   God is good, all the time
   Through the darkest night His light will shine
   God is good
   God is good
   All the time!***

We were sinners and so unworthy
Still for us He chose to die
Filled us with His Holy Spirit
Now we can stand and testify
That His love is everlasting
And His mercies, they will never end

 ** * God is good, all the time
   He put a song of praise
     in this heart of mine
   God is good, all the time
   Through the darkest night
     His light will shine***

 ** * God is good
   God is good
   God is good
   God is good
   God is good
   He's so good
   All the time!***
