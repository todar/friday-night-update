For all that You've done I will thank You
For all that You're going to do
For all that You've promised and all that You are
Is all that has carried me through
Jesus, I thank You

<strong>[men lead, women echo]</strong>
And I thank You, thank You, Lord    <strong>(2x)</strong>

Thank You for loving and setting me free
Thank You for giving Your life just for me
How I thank You, Jesus I thank You
Gratefully thank You
Thank You
