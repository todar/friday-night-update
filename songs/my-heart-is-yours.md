I give You my life
I give You my trust
Jesus
You are my God
You are enough
Jesus
Jesus

My heart is Yours
My heart is Yours
Take it all, take it all
My life in Your hands

I lay down my life
And take up my cross
Jesus
You are my God
Whatever the cost
Jesus, Jesus

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

All to Jesus I surrender
All to You I freely give
I will ever love and trust You
In Your presence I will live
