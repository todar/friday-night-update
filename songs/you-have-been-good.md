Oh Lord, You have been good
You have been faithful to all generations
Oh Lord, Your steadfast love
and tender mercy have been our salvation

For by Your hand we have been fed
And by Your Spirit we have been led

Oh Lord, Almighty God
Father unchanging, upright and holy
Oh Lord, You have been good
You have been faithful
You have been good

You have been good
You have been faithful
You have been good
