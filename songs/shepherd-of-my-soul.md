Shepherd of my soul
I give You full control
Wherever You may lead, I will follow
I have made the choice
To listen for Your voice
Wherever You may lead, I will go

Be it in a quiet pasture
Or by a gentle stream
The Shepherd of my soul is by my side

Should I face a mighty mountain
Or a valley dark and deep
The Shepherd of my soul will be my guide
