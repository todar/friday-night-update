I have a Maker
He formed my heart
Before the world began
My life was in His hands

 ***He knows my name
  He knows my every thought
  He sees each tear that falls
  And hears me when I call***

I have a Father
He calls me His own
He'll never leave me
I want to stay close to His heart

 ***He knows my name
  He knows my every thought
  He sees each tear that falls
  And hears me when I call***

 ***He knows my name
  He knows my every thought
  He sees each tear that falls
  And hears me when I call***

 ***He hears me when I call***
