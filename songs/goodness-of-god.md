I love You, Lord
For Your mercy never fails me
All my days
I've been held in Your hands
From the moment that I wake up
Until I lay my head
I will sing
 of the goodness of God

 ** *All my life You have been faithful
  All my life You have been so, so good
  With every breath that I am able
  I will sing of the goodness of God***

I love Your voice
You have led me through the fire
In the darkest night
You are close like no other
I've known You as a Father
I've known You as a Friend
And I have lived
 in the goodness of God

 ** *All my life You have been faithful
  All my life You have been so, so good
  With every breath that I am able
  I will sing of the goodness of God***

Your goodness is running after
 It's running after me
Your goodness is running after
 It's running after me
With my life laid down
 I'm surrendered now
I give You everything
Your goodness is running after
 It's running after me

 ** *All my life You have been faithful
  All my life You have been so, so good
  With every breath that I am able
  I will sing of the goodness of God***

 ** *I will sing of the goodness of God***
