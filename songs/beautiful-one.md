Wonderful, so wonderful
Is Your unfailing love
Your cross has spoken mercy over me

No eye has seen, no ear has heard
No heart can fully know
How glorious, how beautiful You are

Beautiful One I love
Beautiful One I adore
Beautiful One
My soul must sing!

Powerful, so powerful
Your glory fills the skies
Your mighty works displayed for all to see

The beauty of Your majesty
Awakes my heart to sing
How marvelous, how wonderful You are

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

You opened my eyes to Your wonders anew
You captured my heart with this love
Because nothing on earth is as beautiful as You
