All of creation, all of the earth
Make straight a highway, a path for the Lord
Jesus is coming soon

Call back the sinner, wake up the saint
Let every nation, shout of Your fame
Jesus is coming soon

Like a bride waiting for her groom
We'll be a church ready for You
Every heart longing for our King
We sing, Even so come
Lord Jesus come
Even so come
Lord Jesus come

There will be justice, all will be new
Your name forever, faithful and true
Jesus is coming soon

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

So we wait, we wait for You
God we wait, You're coming soon    <strong>(Repeat)</strong>

Like a bride
Waiting for her groom
We'll be a church
Ready for You
Every heart longing for our King
We sing, we sing

Even so come
Lord Jesus come    <strong>(4x)</strong>
