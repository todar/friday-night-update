Let's think about our God, our Savior and our King
The One who gave it all, He gave up everything

Let's think about the Man, who shed His precious blood
So we could be His friends, His friends until the end

And give our love and praise to Him
He is our Savior and our friend
Let's give our love and praise to Him
He is our Savior and our friend

Let's think about our Father's heart, so right and true
He's never given up, given up on me or You

Let's think about our God, His love and mercy free
He's washed us white as snow, for all eternity

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

Let's think about our Father's heart, so right and true
He's never given up, given up on me or you

Let's think about our God, His love and mercy free
He's washed us white as snow, for all eternity
