<strong>[men]</strong>
When I wake up with dragon breath
And sleepy bugs in my eyes
I think, "How can I shine
When I don't even want to rise?"
But then I think of You
And it makes me smile and say
"Thank You, Lord, for givin' me this
Wonderful day!"

Oh, Lord, I thank You
I really thank You
I'll thank You all the days of my life   <strong>[repeat]</strong>

<strong>[women]</strong>
When I wake up with puppy dog breath
And sleepy bugs in my eyes
I think, "How can I shine
When I don't even want to rise?"
But then I think of You
And it makes me smile and say
"Thank You, Lord, for givin' me this
Wonderful day!"

Jesus, I thank You
I thank You
I'll thank You all my life
Jesus, I thank You
I thank You
I'll thank You all the days of my life
