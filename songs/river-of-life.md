I've got a river of life flowing out of me
Makes the lame to walk and the blind to see
Opens prison doors, sets the captives free
I've got a river of life flowing out of me!

Spring up, o well, within my soul
Spring up, o well, and make me whole
Spring up, o well, and give to me
That life abundantly
