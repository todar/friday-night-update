Jesus loves me, this I know
For the Bible tells me so
Little ones to Him belong
They are weak but He is strong

 ***Yes, Jesus loves me
  Yes, Jesus loves me
  Yes, Jesus loves me
  The Bible tells me so***

Jesus loves me
He who died
Heaven's gate to open wide
He has washed away my sin
Welcomes us to walk with Him

 ***Yes, Jesus loves me
  Yes, Jesus loves me
  Yes, Jesus loves me
  The Bible tells me so***

Jesus loves me
He who lives
Praise Him for the grace He gives
I now show the world His love
Lead them to true life above

 ***Yes, Jesus loves me
  Yes, Jesus loves me
  Yes, Jesus loves me
  The Bible tells me so***
