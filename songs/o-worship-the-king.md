<strong>(Psalm 104)</strong>
O worship the King, all glorious above
And gratefully sing His wonderful love
Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days
Pavilioned in splendor and girded with praise

Your bountiful care, what tongue can recite?
It breathes in the air, it shines in the light
Your mercies how tender, how firm to the end
Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend

O measureless Might, unchangeable Love
Whom angels delight to worship above!
Your ransomed creation, with glory ablaze
In true adoration shall sing to Your praise!
