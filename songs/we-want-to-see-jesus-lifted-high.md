We want to see Jesus lifted high
A banner that flies across this land
That all men might see the Truth and know
He is the way to heaven

We want to see, we want to see
We want to see Jesus lifted high

Step by step we're moving forward
Little by little, taking ground
Every prayer a powerful weapon
Strongholds come tumbling down
And down and down and down…
