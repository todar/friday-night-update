  (Isaiah 66:12)

Now when peace like a river
attendeth my soul
And when sorrows like sea billows roll
Then whatever my lot
You have taught me to say
It is well
It is well with my soul 

 It is well with my soul
 when the storms of winter blow
 And the cares of this world take their toll
 In the heat of the day
 there is grace enough to say
 It is well, it is well with my soul

And when Satan should tempt me
and trials should come
Let this blessed assurance control
For He sees every weakness
and knows every fear
And has shed His own blood for my soul

 It is well with my soul
 when the storms of winter blow
 And the cares of this world take their toll
 In the heat of the day
 there is grace enough to say
 It is well, it is well with my soul

And my sin, oh the joy
of this glorious thought
That my sin, not in part, but the whole
Has been nailed to the cross
and I bear it no more
Praise the Lord!
Praise the Lord, O my soul!

 It is well with my soul
 when the storms of winter blow
 And the cares of this world take their toll
 In the heat of the day
 there is grace enough to say
 It is well, it is well with my soul

And Lord, haste the day
when my faith shall be sight
And the clouds be rolled back as a scroll
Then the trumpet shall sound
and the Lord shall descend
Until then, it is well with my soul

 It is well with my soul
 when the storms of winter blow
 And the cares of this world take their toll
 In the heat of the day
 there is grace enough to say
 It is well, it is well with my soul

 In the heat of the day
 there is grace enough to say
 It is well, it is well with my soul

 It is well
 It is well with my soul
