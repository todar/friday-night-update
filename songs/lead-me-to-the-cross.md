Savior, I come
Quiet my soul, remember
Redemption's hill
Where Your blood was spilled
For my ransom
Everything I once held dear
I count it all as loss

Lead me to the cross
Where Your love poured out
Bring me to my knees
Lord I lay me down
Rid me of myself
I belong to You
Lead me, lead me to the cross

You were as I
Tempted and trialed
Human
The Word became flesh
Bore my sin and death
Now You're risen
Everything I once held dear
I count it all as loss

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

To Your heart
To Your heart
Lead me to Your heart
Lead me to Your heart
