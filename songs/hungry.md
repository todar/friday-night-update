Hungry, I come to You
For I know You satisfy
I am empty but I know
Your love does not run dry

So I'll wait for You   <strong>(2x)</strong>
I'm falling on my knees
Offering all of me
Jesus, You're all this heart is living for

Broken, I run to You
For Your arms are open wide
I am weary but I know
Your touch restores my life
