I just want to be where You are
Dwelling daily in Your presence
I don't want to worship from afar
Draw me near to where You are 

I just want to be where You are
In Your dwelling place forever
Take me to the place where You are
I just want to be with You

 I want to be where You are
 Dwelling in Your presence
 Feasting at Your table
 Surrounded by Your glory

 In Your presence
 That's where I always want to be
 I just want to be
 I just want to be with You

I just want to be where You are
To enter boldly in Your presence
I don't want to worship from afar
Draw me near to where You are

 O my God
 You are my strength and my song
 And when I'm in Your presence
 Though I'm weak
 You're always strong

I just want to be where You are
Dwelling daily in Your presence
I don't want to worship from afar
Draw me near to where You are 

I just want to be where You are
In Your dwelling place forever
Take me to the place where You are
I just want to be
I just want to be with You
I just want to be
I just want to be with You
