 **\    (Habakkuk 3:17-19)**

Though the fig tree should not blossom
And there be no fruit on the vines
Though the fig tree should not blossom
And there be no fruit on the vines

 ** *Yet I will exult in the LORD
  I will exult in the LORD
  I will rejoice
   in the God of my salvation
  I will exult in the LORD***

Though the yield of the olive should fail
And the fields produce no food
Though the yield of the olive should fail
And the fields produce no food

 ** *Yet I will exult in the LORD
  I will exult in the LORD
  I will rejoice
   in the God of my salvation
  I will exult in the LORD***

Though the flock should be cut off from the fold
And there be no cattle in the stalls
Though the flock should be cut off from the fold
And there be no cattle in the stalls

 ** *Yet I will exult in the LORD
  I will exult in the LORD
  I will rejoice
   in the God of my salvation
  I will exult in the LORD***

 ** *I will exult in the LORD
  I will exult in the LORD
  I will rejoice
   in the God of my salvation***

 ** *I will exult
  I will exult
  I will exult in the LORD***
