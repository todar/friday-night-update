Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father
There is no shadow of turning with Thee
Thou changest not
Thy compassions, they fail not
As Thou hast been, Thou forever will be

   Great is Thy faithfulness
   Great is Thy faithfulness
   Morning by morning, new mercies I see
   All I have needed Thy hand hath provided
   Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me

Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth
Thine own dear presence
To cheer and to guide
Strength for today
And bright hope for tomorrow
Blessings all mine
With ten thousand beside

   Great is Thy faithfulness
   Great is Thy faithfulness
   Morning by morning, new mercies I see
   All I have needed Thy hand hath provided
   Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me

   Great is Thy faithfulness
   Great is Thy faithfulness
   Morning by morning, new mercies I see
   All I have needed Thy hand hath provided

   Great is Thy faithfulness
   Great is Thy faithfulness\
   Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me
