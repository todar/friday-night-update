<strong>(Jeremiah 32:17,19)</strong>
Ah Lord God, Thou hast made the heavens
And the earth by Thy great power
Ah Lord God, Thou hast made the heavens
And the earth by Thine outstretched arm

Nothing is too difficult for Thee
Nothing is too difficult for Thee

Great and mighty God
Great in counsel and mighty in deed

Nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing
Nothing is too difficult for Thee
