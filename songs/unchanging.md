Great is Your faithfulness
Great is Your faithfulness
You never change, You never fail, O God

So we raise up holy hands
To praise the Holy One
Who was and is and is to come

True are Your promises…

Wide is Your love and grace…

You were, You are, You will always be
You were, You are, You will always be
