Great is Your faithfulness
Great is Your faithfulness
You never change
You never fail, O God

True are your promises
True are your promises
You never change
You never fail, O God

 ** *So we raise up holy hands
  To praise the holy One
  Who was, and is, and is to come
  Yes we raise up holy hands
  To praise the holy One
  Who was, and is, and is to come***

Wide is Your love and grace
Wide is Your love and grace
You never change
You never fail, O God

 ** *So we raise up holy hands
  To praise the holy One
  Who was, and is, and is to come
  Yes we raise up holy hands
  To praise the holy One
  Who was, and is, and is to come***

You were
You are
You will always be

You were
You are
You will always be

 ** *So we raise up holy hands
  To praise the holy One
  Who was, and is, and is to come
  Yes we raise up holy hands
  To praise the holy One
  Who was, and is, and is to come***

 ** *Yes we raise up holy hands
  To praise the holy One
  Who was, and is, and is to come
  Who was, and is, and is to come***
