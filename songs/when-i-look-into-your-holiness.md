When I look into Your holiness
When I gaze into Your loveliness
When all things that surround
Become shadows in the light of You

When I've found the joy of reaching Your heart
When my will becomes enthralled in Your love
When all things that surround
Become shadows in the light of You

I worship You
I worship You
The reason I live is to worship You
