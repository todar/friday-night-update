Everyone needs compassion
Love that's never failing
Let mercy fall on me
Everyone needs forgiveness
The kindness of a Savior
The hope of nations

 ** * My Savior
   He can move the mountains
   My God is mighty to save
   He is mighty to save
   Forever
   Author of salvation
   He rose and conquered the grave
   Jesus conquered the grave***

So take me as You find me
All my fears and failures
Fill my life again
I give my life to follow
Everything I believe in
Now I surrender

 ** * My Savior
   He can move the mountains
   My God is mighty to save
   He is mighty to save
   Forever
   Author of salvation
   He rose and conquered the grave
   Jesus conquered the grave***

Shine Your light and let the whole world see
We're singing
For the glory of the risen King

Shine Your light and let the whole world see
We're singing
For the glory of the risen King

 ** * My Savior
   He can move the mountains
   My God is mighty to save
   He is mighty to save
   Forever
   Author of salvation
   He rose and conquered the grave
   Jesus conquered the grave***
