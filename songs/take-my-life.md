Take my life and let it be
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee
Take my moments and my days
Let them flow in ceaseless praise
Take my hands and let them move
At the impulse of Thy love
Take my feet and let them be
Swift and beautiful for Thee

Take my voice and let me sing
Always only for my King
Take my lips and let them be
Filled with messages from Thee
Take my silver and my gold
Not a mite would I withhold
Take my intellect and use
Every power as You choose

 ***Here am I***  (echo)
 ***All of me***  (echo)
 ***Take my life***  (echo)
 ***It's all for Thee***  (echo)

Take my will and make it Thine
It shall be no longer mine
Take my heart it is Thine own
It shall be Thy royal throne
Take my love, my Lord, I pour
At Your feet its treasure store
Take myself and I will be
Ever, only, all for Thee

 ***Here am I***  (echo)
 ***All of me***  (echo)
 ***Take my life***  (echo)
 ***It's all for Thee***  (echo)

 ***Here am I***  (echo)
 ***All of me***  (echo)
 ***Take my life***  (echo)
 ***It's all for Thee***  (echo)

Take my life and let it be
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee
