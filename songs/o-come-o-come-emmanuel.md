O come, O come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear

 ** * Rejoice! Rejoice!
   Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel*** 

O come, Thou Day-spring, come and cheer
Our spirits by Thine advent here
And drive away the shades of night
And pierce the clouds and bring us light

 ** * Rejoice! Rejoice!
   Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel***
