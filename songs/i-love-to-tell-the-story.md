I love to tell the story
Of unseen things above
Of Jesus and His glory
Of Jesus and His love
I love to tell the story
Because I know 'tis true
It satisfies my longings
As nothing else can do

I love to tell the story
'twill be my theme in Glory
To tell the old, old story
of Jesus and His love

I love to tell the story
'Tis pleasant to repeat
It seems, each time I tell it, 
More wonderfully sweet
I love to tell the story
For some have never heard
The message of salvation
From God's own holy word

I love to tell the story
For those who know it best
Seem hungering and thirsting
To hear it, like the rest
And when, in scenes of Glory
I sing the new, new song
'Twill be the old, old story
That I have loved so long
