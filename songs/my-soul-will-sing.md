<strong>(Psalm 103)</strong>


My soul will sing with all the strength I have in me
I will rejoice with every day He gives
I will recall the wonders He has shown to me
His power to heal \
His mercy to forgive
We join with angels to sing His praises
He does not treat us as our sins deserve

  High as the heavens reach above the earth
  Is Your unfailing love\
  Is Your unfailing love
  Far as the east is banished from the west
  You took our sins from us\
  Removed our sins from us
  How wide, how high is Your unfailing love

Our King delights to show compassion to the weak
Their deepest needs He loves to satisfy
Throughout the earth His justice and His mercy speak
And He will run to meet the victim's cry
From everlasting to everlasting
Our youth renewed with every step we take

  High as the heavens reach above the earth
  Is Your unfailing love\
  Is Your unfailing love
  Far as the east is banished from the west
  You took our sins from us\
  Removed our sins from us\
  How wide, how high\
  How wide, how high
  How wide, how high is Your unfailing love

Though we are dust a moment in eternity
As flowers bloom today and then are gone
He crowns our lives with beauty and with dignity
His patience smiles on all who turn to Him
From generation to generation
We'll tell the story of His faithfulness

  High as the heavens reach above the earth
  Is Your unfailing love\
  Is Your unfailing love
  Far as the east is banished from the west
  You took our sins from us\
  Removed our sins from us

  High as the heavens reach above the earth
  Is Your unfailing love\
  Is Your unfailing love
  Far as the east is banished from the west
  You took our sins from us\
  Removed our sins from us
  How wide, how high\
  How wide, how high
  How wide, how high is Your unfailing love
