When peace, like a river, attendeth my way
When sorrows, like sea billows, roll
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say
"It is well, it is well with my soul"

\     * \[men lead, women echo]*
 ** *It is well
  With my soul
  It is well, it is well, with my soul*** 

Though Satan should buffet
Though trials should come
Let this blest assurance control
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate
And hath shed His own blood for my soul

 ** *It is well
  With my soul
  It is well, it is well, with my soul*** 

My sin, oh the joy of this glorious thought:
My sin, not in part, but the whole
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

 ** *It is well
  With my soul
  It is well, it is well, with my soul*** 

And Lord, haste the day
When my faith shall be sight
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll
The trump shall resound
And the Lord shall descend
Even so, it is well with my soul

 ** *It is well
  With my soul
  It is well, it is well, with my soul*** 

 ** *It is well, it is well, with my soul***
