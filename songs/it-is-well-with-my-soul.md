When peace, like a river, attendeth my way
When sorrows, like sea billows, roll
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say
"It is well, it is well with my soul"

<strong>[men lead, women echo]</strong>
It is well
With my soul
It is well, it is well, with my soul

Though Satan should buffet
Though trials should come
Let this blest assurance control
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate
And hath shed His own blood for my soul

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

My sin, oh the joy of this glorious thought:
My sin, not in part, but the whole
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

And Lord, haste the day
When my faith shall be sight
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll
The trump shall resound
And the Lord shall descend
Even so, it is well with my soul
