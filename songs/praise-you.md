King of angels, King of saints
King of all creation praise
King of lost and King of found
King who wore my thorny crown
Crucified to set me free
King of glory, now my eyes can see Your majesty

And I praise You, I praise You
I praise You, I praise You for all eternity
I will sing, I will sing
I will sing, I will sing to You, Jesus my King

King of sunshine, King of rain
King of all my waking days
King in joy and King through pain
You will always be the same
Sing aloud my soul awake
Sing of His unfailing love and grace
All my days

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

All heaven shines with You
As angel eyes behold Your face
No one else compares with You
So I'll bow in awe of You
