There is a love so sure
Nothing it can't endure
There is a life it brings
That's greater than anything
I once was dead within
Hollowed by all my sin
Lost and so led astray
But Your love reached all the way
Your love reached all the way

Oh, the wondrous Cross
Where the Prince of Glory died
Oh, the glorious Cross
Where Your mercy bled for us
You overcame the grave
Waking to a world You saved
Oh, the wondrous Cross

Now You're my resting place
When trouble I must face
I won't be overwhelmed
Jesus, Your love has won
And my faith looks up to Thee
Sweet Lamb of Calvary
My song will ever rise
To You alone

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

Hallelujah    <strong>(3x)</strong>
Worthy is the Lamb
