God rest ye merry, gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ our Savior
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray

 ** *O tidings of comfort and joy
  Comfort and joy
  O tidings of comfort and joy***

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by name

 ** *O tidings of comfort and joy
  Comfort and joy
  O tidings of comfort and joy***

"Fear not then," said the angel
"Let nothing you affright
This day is born a Savior
Of a pure Virgin bright
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might"

 ** *O tidings of comfort and joy
  Comfort and joy
  O tidings of comfort and joy***

Now to the Lord sing praises
All you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace
In holy celebration
Lift up your joyous face

 ** *O tidings of comfort and joy
  Comfort and joy
  O tidings of comfort and joy***
