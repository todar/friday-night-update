<strong>(Psalm 84:1,2)</strong>


How lovely is Your dwelling place
O Lord Almighty
For my soul longs and even faints for You
For here my heart is satisfied
Within Your presence
I rest beneath the shadow of Your wings

 ** *Better is one day in Your courts
  Better is one day in Your house
  Better is one day in Your courts
  Than thousands elsewhere
  Better is one day in Your courts
  Better is one day in Your house
  Better is one day in Your courts
  Than thousands elsewhere
  Than thousands elsewhere***

One thing I ask and I would seek
To see Your beauty
To find You in the place Your glory dwells
One thing I ask and I would seek
To see Your beauty
To find You in the place Your glory dwells

 ** *Better is one day in Your courts
  Better is one day in Your house
  Better is one day in Your courts
  Than thousands elsewhere
  Better is one day in Your courts
  Better is one day in Your house
  Better is one day in Your courts
  Than thousands elsewhere
  Than thousands elsewhere***

My heart and flesh cry out
To You the Living God
Your Spirit's water to my soul
I've tasted and I've seen
Come once again to me
I will draw near to You
I will draw near to You

 ** *Better is one day
  Better is one day
  Better is one day
  Than thousands elsewhere
  Better is one day
  Better is one day
  Better is one day
  Than thousands elsewhere
  Than thousands elsewhere***

How lovely is Your dwelling place
O Lord Almighty
For my soul longs and even faints for You
For here my heart is satisfied
Within Your presence
I rest beneath the shadow of Your wings

 ** *Better is one day in Your courts
  Better is one day in Your house
  Better is one day in Your courts
  Than thousands elsewhere
  Better is one day in Your courts
  Better is one day in Your house
  Better is one day in Your courts
  Than thousands elsewhere
  Than thousands elsewhere***

My heart and flesh cry out
To You the Living God
Your Spirit's water to my soul
I've tasted and I've seen
Come once again to me
I will draw near to You
I will draw near to You

 ** *Better is one day in Your courts
  Better is one day in Your house
  Better is one day in Your courts
  Than thousands elsewhere
  Better is one day in Your courts
  Better is one day in Your house
  Better is one day in Your courts
  Than thousands elsewhere
  Than thousands elsewhere***
