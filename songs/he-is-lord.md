<strong>(Philippians 2:10-11)</strong>
He is Lord, He is Lord
He is risen from the dead
And He is Lord

Every knee shall bow
Every tongue confess
That Jesus Christ is Lord


You're my Lord, You're my Lord
You have risen from the dead
And You're my Lord

So my knee shall bow
And my tongue confess
That Jesus Christ is Lord
