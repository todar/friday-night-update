There is a Redeemer
Jesus, God's own Son
Precious Lamb of God, Messiah
Holy One

Jesus, my Redeemer
Name above all names
Precious Lamb of God, Messiah
Oh, for sinners slain

 ***Thank You, oh my Father
  For giving us Your Son
  And leaving Your Spirit till
  The work on earth is done***

When I stand in glory
I will see Your face
There I'll serve my King forever
In that holy place

 ***Thank You, oh my Father
  For giving us Your Son
  And leaving Your Spirit till
  The work on earth is done***
