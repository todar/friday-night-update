Great are You Lord
Mighty in strength
You are faithful
You will ever be
We will praise You all of our days
It's for Your glory
We offer everything

Raise your hands, all you nations
Shout to God all creation
How awesome is the Lord Most High
We will praise You together
Both now and forever
How awesome is the Lord Most High

Where You send us
God, we will go
You're the answer
We want the world to know
We will trust You when You call our name
Where You lead us we'll follow all the way

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
How awesome is the Lord Most High
