Oh, to see the dawn of the darkest day
Christ on the road to Calvary
Tried by sinful men
Torn and beaten, then
Nailed to a cross of wood

 ** *This, the power of the cross:
  Christ became sin for us
  Took the blame, bore the wrath
  We stand forgiven at the cross***

Oh, to see the pain written on Your face
Bearing the awesome weight of sin
Every bitter thought, every evil deed
Crowning Your bloodstained brow

 ** *This, the power of the cross:
  Christ became sin for us
  Took the blame, bore the wrath
  We stand forgiven at the cross***

Now the daylight flees
Now the ground beneath
Quakes as its Maker bows His head
Curtain torn in two
Dead are raised to life
"Finished!" the victory cry

 ** *This, the power of the cross:
  Christ became sin for us
  Took the blame, bore the wrath
  We stand forgiven at the cross***

Oh, to see my name written in the wounds
For through Your suffering I am free
Death is crushed to death
Life is mine to live
Won through Your selfless love

 ** *This, the power of the cross:
  Son of God, slain for us
  What a love! What a cost!
  We stand forgiven at the cross***
