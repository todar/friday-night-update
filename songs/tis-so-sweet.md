'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus
Just to take Him at His word
Just to rest upon His promise
Just to know, "Thus saith the Lord"

 ***Jesus, Jesus, how I trust You
  How I've proved You o'er and o'er
  Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus
  Oh, for grace to trust You more***

Oh, how sweet to trust in Jesus
Just to trust His cleansing blood
And in simple faith to plunge me
'neath the healing, cleansing flood

 ***Jesus, Jesus, how I trust You
  How I've proved You o'er and o'er
  Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus
  Oh, for grace to trust You more***

Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus
Just from sin and self to cease
Just from Jesus simply taking
Life and rest, and joy and peace

 ***Jesus, Jesus, how I trust You
  How I've proved You o'er and o'er
  Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus
  Oh, for grace to trust You more***

I'm so glad I learned to trust You
Precious Jesus, Savior, friend
And I know that You are with me
Will be with me to the end!

 ***Jesus, Jesus, how I trust You
  How I've proved You o'er and o'er
  Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus
  Oh, for grace to trust You more***
