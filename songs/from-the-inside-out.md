A thousand times I've failed
Still Your mercy remains
Should I stumble again
Still I'm caught in Your grace
Everlasting, Your light will shine
When all else fades
Never ending, Your glory goes beyond all fame

Your will above all else, My purpose remains
The art of losing myself in bringing You praise
Everlasting, Your light will shine
When all else fades
Never ending, Your glory goes beyond all fame

In my heart, in my soul
I give You control
Consume me from the inside out, Lord
Let justice and praise
Become my embrace
To love You from the inside out

Everlasting, Your light will shine
When all else fades
Never ending, Your glory goes beyond all fame
And the cry of my heart is to bring You praise

From the inside out
Lord, my soul cries out
