You are God in heaven

So I'll let my words be few
Jesus, I am so in love with You

You are God in heaven
And here am I on earth

The simplest of all love songs
I want to bring to You
So I'll let my words be few
Jesus, I am so in love with You

  Yes I'll stand in awe of You
  And I'll let my words be few
  Jesus, I am so in love with You***
