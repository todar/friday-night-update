There is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Immanuel's veins
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains    <strong>(3x)</strong>
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains

The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day
And there have I, though vile as he
Washed all my sins away    <strong>(3x)</strong>
And there have I, though vile as he
Washed all my sins away

Dear dying Lamb, Your precious blood
Shall never lose its power
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved, to sin no more    <strong>(3x)</strong>
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved, to sin no more

Ever since, by faith, I saw the stream
Your flowing wounds supply
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die    <strong>(3x)</strong>
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die
