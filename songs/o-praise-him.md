Turn Your ear to Heaven and hear
The noise inside
The sound of angels' awe
The sound of angels' songs
And all this for a King
We could join and sing,
"All to Christ our King!"

How constant, how divine
This song of ours will rise
O how constant, how divine
This love of ours will rise
Will rise

O Praise Him!
O Praise Him!
He is Holy
He is Holy

Turn your gaze to Heaven and raise
A joyous noise
The sound of salvation come
The sound of rescued ones
And all this for a King
Angels join to sing
"All for Christ our King!"

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

How infinite and sweet
This love so rescuing
O how infinitely sweet
This great love that has redeemed
As one, we sing

Alleluia, Alleluia!
He is Holy
He is Holy
