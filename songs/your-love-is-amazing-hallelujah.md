Your love is amazing, steady and unchanging
Your love is a mountain, firm beneath my feet
Your love is a mystery, how You gently lift me
When I am surrounded, Your love carries me

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Your love makes me sing!

Your love is surprising, I can feel it rising
All the joy that's growing deep inside of me
Every time I see You
All Your goodness shines through
And I can feel this God song rising up in me
