 **\    \[men lead, women echo]**
I will worship
With all of my heart
I will praise You
With all of my strength

I will seek You
All of my days
I will follow
Follow all of Your ways

 ***I will give You all my worship
  I will give You all my praise
  You alone I long to worship
  You alone
   are worthy of my praise***

I will bow down
Hail You as King
I will serve You
Give You everything

I will lift up
My eyes to Your throne
I will trust You
I will trust You alone

 ***I will give You all my worship
  I will give You all my praise
  You alone I long to worship
  You alone
   are worthy of my praise***

I will worship
With all of my heart
I will praise You
With all of my strength

I will seek You
All of my days
I will follow
Follow all of Your ways

 ***I will give You all my worship
  I will give You all my praise
  You alone I long to worship
  You alone
   are worthy of my praise***

I will bow down
Hail You as King
I will serve You
Give You everything

My eyes to Your throne
I will trust You
