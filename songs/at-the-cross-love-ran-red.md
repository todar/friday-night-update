There's a place where mercy reigns
And never dies
There's a place where streams of grace
Flow deep and wide
Where all the love I've ever found
Comes like a flood
Comes flowing down

At the cross
At the cross
I surrender my life
I'm in awe of You
I'm in awe of You
Where Your love ran red
And my sin washed white
I owe all to You
I owe all to You Jesus

There's a place where sin and shame
Are powerless
Where my heart has peace with God
And forgiveness
Where all the love I've ever found
Comes like a flood
Comes flowing down

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

Here my hope is found
Here on holy ground
Here I bow down
Here I bow down
Here arms open wide
Here You saved my life
Here I bow down
Here I bow
