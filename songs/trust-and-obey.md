When we walk with the Lord
In the light of His Word
What a glory He sheds on our way
While we do His good will
 He abides with us still
And with all who will trust and obey

 ***Trust and obey
  For there's no other way
  To be happy in Jesus
  But to trust and obey***

For we never can prove
 the delights of His love
Until all on the altar we lay
For the favor He shows
 and the joy He bestows
Are for those who will trust and obey

 ***Trust and obey
  For there's no other way
  To be happy in Jesus
  But to trust and obey***

Then in fellowship sweet we will sit at His feet
Or we'll walk by His side in the way
What He says we will do
Where He sends we will go
Never fear, only trust and obey

 ***Trust and obey
  For there's no other way
  To be happy in Jesus
  But to trust and obey***
