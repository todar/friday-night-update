All creatures of our God and King
Lift up your voice and with us sing
Alleluia, alleluia!
Thou burning sun with golden beam
Thou silver moon with softer gleam
O praise Him, O praise Him!
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

Thou rushing wind that art so strong
Ye clouds that sail in heav'n along
O praise Him, alleluia!
Thou rising moon in praise rejoice
Ye lights of evening find a voice
O praise Him, O praise Him!
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

Let all things their Creator bless
And worship Him in humbleness
O praise Him, alleluia!
Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son
And praise the Spirit, Three in One
O praise Him, O praise Him
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!
