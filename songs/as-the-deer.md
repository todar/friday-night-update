\    (Psalm 42:1)

As the deer panteth for the water
So my soul longeth after Thee
You alone are my heart’s desire
And I long to worship Thee

 ** *You alone are my Strength, my Shield
  To You alone may my spirit yield
  You alone are my heart’s desire
  And I long to worship Thee***

You’re my Friend and You are my Brother
Even though You are a King
I love You more than any other
So much more than anything

 ** *You alone are my Strength, my Shield
  To You alone may my spirit yield
  You alone are my heart’s desire
  And I long to worship Thee***

I want You more than gold or silver
Only You can satisfy
You alone are the real joy-giver
And the apple of my eye

 ** *You alone are my Strength, my Shield
  To You alone may my spirit yield
  You alone are my heart’s desire
  And I long to worship Thee***

 ** *And I long to worship Thee***
