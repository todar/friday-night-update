Some glad morning when this life is over
I'll fly away
To my home on God's celestial shore
I'll fly away

I'll fly away, O glory
I'll fly away
When I die, Hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away

When the shadows of this life have gone
I'll fly away
Like a bird from prison bars has flown
I'll fly away

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To a land where joy shall never end
I'll fly away
