<strong>(Psalm 100:5)</strong>
For the Lord is good
And His love endures forever
He's a faithful God to all generations

For the Lord is good
And His mercies will not fail us
They are new each day
O lift Your voice and say
"The Lord is good!"

Great is Your faithfulness, O Lord    <strong>[Echo]</strong>
Your lovingkindness
Fills our hearts to overflowing
Songs of rejoicing and sweet praise <strong>(Songs of praise)</strong>
They fill our hearts    <strong>[Echo]</strong>
They fill our days
