<strong>(Psalm 100:5)</strong>
For the Lord is good
And His love endures forever
He's a faithful God
to all generations

For the Lord is good
And His mercies will not fail us
They are new each day
O lift your voice and say
"The Lord is good!"

(Men) Great is Your faithfulness, O Lord  (echo)
(Men) Your lovingkindness fills
(all)                     our hearts to overflowing
(Men) Songs of rejoicing and sweet praise
(Women)                                      songs of praise
(Men) They fill our hearts  (echo)
(all) They fill our days     

For the Lord is good
And His love endures forever
He's a faithful God
to all generations

For the Lord is good
And His mercies will not fail us
They are new each day
O lift your voice and say
"The Lord is good!"

(Men) Great is Your faithfulness, O Lord  (echo)
(Men) Your lovingkindness fills
(all)                     our hearts to overflowing
(Men) Songs of rejoicing and sweet praise
(Women)                                      songs of praise
(Men) They fill our hearts  (echo)
(all) They fill our days    

For the Lord is good
And His love endures forever
He's a faithful God
to all generations

For the Lord is good
And His mercies will not fail us
They are new each day
O lift your voice and say
"The Lord is good!"
"The Lord is good!"
"The Lord is good!"
