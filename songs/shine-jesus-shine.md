Lord, the light of Your love is shining
In the midst of the darkness shining
Jesus, light of the world shine upon us
Set us free by the truth You now bring us
Shine on me, Shine on me

 ***Shine, Jesus, shine
  Fill this land with the Father’s glory
  Blaze, Spirit, blaze
  Set our hearts on fire***

 ***Flow, river, flow
  Flood the nations with grace and mercy
  Send forth Your word, Lord
  And let there be light***

Lord, I come to Your awesome presence
From the shadows into Your radiance
By the blood I may enter Your brightness
Search me, try me, consume all my darkness
Shine on me, Shine on me

 ***Shine, Jesus, shine
  Fill this land with the Father’s glory
  Blaze, Spirit, blaze
  Set our hearts on fire***

 ***Flow, river, flow
  Flood the nations with grace and mercy
  Send forth Your word, Lord
  And let there be light***

As we gaze on Your Kingly brightness
So our faces display Your likeness
Ever changing from glory to glory
Mirrored here may our lives tell Your story
Shine on me, Shine on me

 ***Shine, Jesus, shine
  Fill this land with the Father’s glory
  Blaze, Spirit, blaze
  Set our hearts on fire***

 ***Flow, river, flow
  Flood the nations with grace and mercy
  Send forth Your word, Lord
  And let there be light***
