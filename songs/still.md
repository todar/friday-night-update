Hide me now
Under Your wings
Cover me
Within Your mighty hands

 ***When the oceans rise and thunders roar
  I will soar with You above the storm
  Father, You are king over the flood
  I will be still
   and know You are God***

Find rest my soul
In Christ alone
Know His power
In quietness and trust

 ***When the oceans rise and thunders roar
  I will soar with You above the storm
  Father, You are king over the flood
  I will be still
   and know You are God***

 ***When the oceans rise and thunders roar
  I will soar with You above the storm
  Father, You are king over the flood
  I will be still
   and know You are God***

 ***I will be still
   and know You are God***
