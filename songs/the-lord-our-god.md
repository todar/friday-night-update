Promise maker, promise keeper
You finish what You begin
Our provision, through the desert
You see it through to the end
You see it through to the end

The Lord our God is ever faithful
Never changing through the ages
From this darkness, You will lead us
And forever we will say
You're the Lord our God

In the silence, in the waiting
Still we can know You are good
All Your plans are for Your glory
Yes we can know You are good
Yes we can know You are good

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

We won't move without You
We won't move without You
You're the light of all and all that we need
