Who is there like You
And who else would give their life for me
Even suffering in my place
And who could repay You
All of creation looks to You
And You provide for all You have made

So I'm lifting up my hands
Lifting up my voice
Lifting up Your name
And in Your grace I rest
For Your love has come to me
And set me free

And I'm trusting in Your word
Trusting in Your cross
Trusting in Your blood
And all Your faithfulness
For Your power at work in me
Is changing me
