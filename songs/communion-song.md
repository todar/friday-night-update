Take this bread I give to you
And as you do, remember Me
This bread is My body broken just for you

<strong>[men]</strong>
Take it
Eat it

Each time you do, remember Me
Remember Me


Take this cup I fill for you
And as you do remember Me
This cup is the new covenant
I'm making with you

Take it
Drink it

Each time you do, remember Me
Remember Me


Take this love I've given you
And as you do, remember Me
Remember Me, Remember Me
