Jesus You're my firm foundation
I know I can stand secure
Jesus You're my firm foundation
I put my hope in Your holy word
I put my hope in Your holy word

<strong>[men lead, women echo]</strong>
I have a living hope
I have a future
God has a plan for me
Of this I'm sure

Of this I'm sure

Your Word is faithful
Mighty in power
God will deliver me
Of this I'm sure

Of this I'm sure
