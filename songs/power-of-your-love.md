Lord, I come to You
Let my heart be changed, renewed
Flowing from the grace that I've found in You

LLord I've come to know
The weaknesses I see in me
Will be stripped away
By the power of Your love

 ***Hold me close
   Let Your love surround me
   Bring me near
   Draw me to Your side
   And as I wait
   I'll rise up like the eagle
   And I will soar with You
   Your Spirit leads me on
   In the power of Your love***

Lord, unveil my eyes
Let me see You face to face
The knowledge of Your love as You live in me

Lord, renew my mind
As Your will unfolds in my life
In living every day by the power of Your love

 ***Hold me close
   Let Your love surround me
   Bring me near
   Draw me to Your side
   And as I wait
   I'll rise up like the eagle
   And I will soar with You
   Your Spirit leads me on
   In the power of Your love***

 ***Hold me close
   Let Your love surround me
   Bring me near
   Draw me to Your side
   And as I wait
   I'll rise up like the eagle
   And I will soar with You
   Your Spirit leads me on***

 ***In the power of Your love
   In the power of Your love
   In the power of Your love***
