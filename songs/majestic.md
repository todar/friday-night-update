O Lord, our Lord
How majestic is Your name in all the earth

The heavens declare Your greatness
The oceans cry out to You
The mountains, they bow down before You
So I'll join with the earth
And I'll give my praise to You

I will worship You
I will worship You
We will worship You
We will worship You
