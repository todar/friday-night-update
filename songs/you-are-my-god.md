You are my God
And I love You, I love You
You are my God
And I need You, I need You

You are my Master
You are my Savior
Your love has lifted me
Out of this world

You are my God
And I praise You, I praise You
You are my God
And I want You, I want You

I need You, I want You
I love You, I praise You
I worship You

You are my God
