This is my Father's world
And to my listening ears
All nature sings
And round me rings
The music of the spheres

This is my Father's world
The birds their carols raise
The morning light
The lily white
Declare their Maker's praise

  This is my Father's world
  I rest me in the thought
  Of rocks and trees
  Of skies and seas
  His hand the wonders wrought

This is my Father's world
Oh, let me ne'er forget
That though the wrong
Seems oft so strong
God is the ruler yet

   This is my Father's world
   Why should my heart be sad?
   The Lord is king
   Let the heavens ring
   God reigns, let the Earth be glad

   This is my Father's world
   He shines in all that's fair
   In the rustling grass
   I hear him pass
   He speaks to me everywhere

   In the rustling grass
   I hear him pass
   He speaks to me everywhere
