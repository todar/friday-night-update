This is my Father's world
And to my listening ears
All nature sings, and round me rings
The music of the spheres

This is my Father's world
I rest me in the thought
Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas
His hand the wonders wrought

This is my Father's world
The birds their carols raise
The morning light, the lily white
Declare their maker's praise

This is my Father's world
He shines in all that's fair
In rustling grass I hear him pass
He speaks to me everywhere

This is my Father's world
O let me ne'er forget
That though the wrong seems oft so strong
God is the ruler yet

This is my Father's world
Why should my heart be sad?
The Lord is King, let the heavens ring
God reigns let the earth be glad
