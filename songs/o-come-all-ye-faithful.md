O come, all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of angels

 ** * O come, let us adore Him
   O come, let us adore Him
   O come, let us adore Him
   Christ the Lord***

Sing, choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing, all ye citizens of Heaven above
Glory to God!
Glory in the highest!

 ** * O come, let us adore Him
   O come, let us adore Him
   O come, let us adore Him
   Christ the Lord***

Yea, Lord, we greet Thee
Born this happy morning
Jesus, to Thee be all glory given
Word of the Father
Now in flesh appearing

 ** * O come, let us adore Him
   O come, let us adore Him
   O come, let us adore Him
   Christ the Lord***
