More than anything, more than anything
I love You, Jesus, more than anything
More than worldly wealth, more than life itself
I love You, Jesus, more than anything

Nothing in this world can take Your place
Or ever take Your love away
Someday I will see You face to face
Look into Your eyes and say...
