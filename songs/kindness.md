Open up the skies of mercy
And rain down the cleansing flood
Healing waters rise around us
Hear our cries Lord 
Let 'em rise

It's Your kindness, Lord
That leads us to repentance
Your favor, Lord, is our desire
It's Your beauty, Lord
That makes us stand in silence
And Your love, Your love
Is better than life

We can feel Your mercy falling
You are turnin' our hearts back again
Hear our praises rise to heaven
Draw us near, Lord
Meet us here
