In His time, in His time
He makes all things beautiful
In His time

Lord please show me every day
As You're teaching me Your way
That You do just what You say
In Your time

In Your time, in Your time
You make all things beautiful
In Your time

Lord my life to You I bring
May each song I have to sing
Be to You a lovely thing
In Your time

Lord my life to You I bring
May each song I have to sing
Be to You a lovely thing
In Your time
