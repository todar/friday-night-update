Holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord
As we bow before Your throne
Majesty and honor to You alone    <strong>(2x)</strong>

Worthy are You, Lord
Worthy are You, Lord
Sweet Lamb of God, the chosen One
Our lives we gladly lay before Your throne    <strong>(2x)</strong>

No longer will we give our hearts
To the things of this world
For a debt of love we will offer to You
We look for the day when every knee will bow
We will join with the angels around Your throne
And we will sing...

Holy is the Lord    <strong>(4x)</strong>
Holy are You, Lord    <strong>(4x)</strong>
