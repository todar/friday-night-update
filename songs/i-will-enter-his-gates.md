<strong>(Psalm 100:4; 92:4)</strong>
I will enter His gates
With thanksgiving in my heart
I will enter His courts with praise
I will say this is the day
That the Lord has made
I will rejoice for He has made me glad

He has made me glad
He has made me glad
I will rejoice for He has made me glad     <strong>[repeat]</strong>

I will enter Your gates
With thanksgiving in my heart
I will enter Your courts with praise
I will say this is the day
That the Lord has made
I will rejoice for You have made me glad

You have made me glad
You have made me glad
I will rejoice for You have made me glad    <strong>[repeat]</strong>
