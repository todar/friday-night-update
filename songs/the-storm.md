Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale
A tale of a fateful trip
That started from this Jewish port
Aboard this tiny ship

Jesus said, "Let's leave this crowd
And go to the other side"
Along with His disciples
They were in for quite a ride   <strong>(2x)</strong>

The weather started getting rough
Fierce winds tossed the sea
And water started filling up
That boat on Galilee

Jesus was oblivious
In the back He was sleeping
They woke Him asking, "Teacher,
Don't You care we're perishing?!"   <strong>(2x)</strong>

Jesus rose and rebuked the wind
He said, "Hush, be still"
It quieted immediately
According to His will   <strong>(2x)</strong>

Jesus turned and asked His men
"Why do you have no faith?"
They wondered, "Who is this, that
Wind and sea do what He saith?"

And that's the tale of the raging
And the calming of the sea
Of the mighty power of Jesus
And His great authority
