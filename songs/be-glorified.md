Your love has captured me
Your grace has set me free
Your life--the air I breathe
Be glorified in me

You set my feet to dancing
You set my heart on fire
In the presence of a thousand kings
You are my one desire
And I stand before You now
With trembling hands lifted high
Be glorified

Be glorified in me
