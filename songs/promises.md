Who are we to know
 the mind of the Lord
For His thoughts
 are not our thoughts
And His perfect plan
 is lighted by His word
How unsearchable His wisdom to us

 ***For joy unspeakable
    lies in His perfect will
   A peace that
    surpasses understanding
   For love is of God
   And all who love
    are born of God
   For God is love***

Seek ye first the kingdom of God
And His righteousness
And all these things
 will be added unto you
For delight yourself in God
And He will grant you
 the desires of your heart

 ***For joy unspeakable
    lies in His perfect will
   A peace that
    surpasses understanding
   For love is of God
   And all who love
    are born of God
   For God is love***

Trust in the Lord
 with all your heart
And lean not unto
 your own understanding
In all your ways acknowledge Him
And He will direct your paths

 ***For joy unspeakable
    lies in His perfect will
   A peace that
    surpasses understanding
   For love is of God
   And all who love
    are born of God
   For God is love***

O Lord, how precious
 is Thy lovingkindness
Therefore I will put my trust
Under the shadow of Thy wings
