My Father, I love You
And for all of my days
I want to praise who You are

You are glorious
You are marvelous
You are my Father who loves me so

   You are the Creator
   You are my Savior
   For all eternity
   I'll praise who You are

O Jesus, I love You
And for all of my days
I want to praise who You are

You are miraculous
You are victorious
You are the Redeemer who bought my soul

   You are the Creator
   You are my Savior
   For all eternity
   I'll praise who You are

My Father, I love You
My Jesus, I love You
And for all of my days
I want to praise who You are

You are glorious
You are marvelous
You are the One I long to know

   You are the Creator
   You are my Savior
   For all eternity
   I'll praise who You are

   For all eternity
   I'll praise who You are
