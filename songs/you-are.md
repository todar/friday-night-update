My Father, I love You
And for all of my days
I want to praise who You are

You are glorious
You are marvelous
You are my Father who loves me so

You are the Creator
You are my Savior
For all eternity
I'll praise who You are

O Jesus, I love You
And for all of my days
I want to praise who You are

You are miraculous
You are victorious
You are the Redeemer who bought my soul

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

My Father, I love You
My Jesus, I love You
And for all of my days
I want to praise who You are

You are glorious
You are marvelous
You are the One I long to know

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

For all eternity
I'll praise who You are
