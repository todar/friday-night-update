Over the mountains and the sea
Your river runs with love for me
And I will open up my heart
And let the Healer set me free

I'm happy to be in the truth
And I will daily lift my hands
For I will always sing
Of when Your love came down

I could sing of Your love forever    <strong>(4x)</strong>

Oh, I feel like dancing
It's foolishness, I know
But when the world has seen the light
They will dance with joy
Like we're dancing now
