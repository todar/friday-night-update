Pure and holy Son of God
Taking on the form of man
Leaving heaven's blest abode
Came to bring salvation's plan

Righteous Father, Holy One
Looking down on us in love
Gave to us His only Son
Sent with blessings from above

   But we took Him and we nailed Him
   To a cross made of wood
   And we raised it high and dropped it
   In the ground where it stood\
   And the blood that flowed to the earth below
   Bought forgiveness for the world
   That had treated Him so

"Peace on earth, good will to men"
At His birth, the angels sang
Love and mercy from the Throne
Through the earth His message rang

   But we took Him and we nailed Him
   To a cross made of wood
   And we raised it high and dropped it
   In the ground where it stood\
   And the blood that flowed to the earth below
   Bought forgiveness for the world
   That had treated Him so

He came in love to bring us light in our darkness
He came in peace to bring release from our pain
He came with joy to bring us rest in our weariness
He came with love to bring us freedom again

   But we took Him and we nailed Him
   To a cross made of wood
   And we raised it high and dropped it
   In the ground where it stood\
   And the blood that flowed to the earth below
   Bought forgiveness for the world
   That had treated Him so

   And the blood that flowed to the earth below
   Bought forgiveness for the world
   That had treated Him so
