He is here, He is here
He is moving among us
He is here, He is here
Let us praise His holy name
He is here, He is here
And His love is such a wonder
Yesterday and today and forevermore the same

He is Lord, He is Lord
Let us worship before Him
He is Lord, He is Lord
Let us praise Him and proclaim:
"You are Lord! You are Lord!
We will follow and obey You"
You are Lord
We exalt Your holy name
