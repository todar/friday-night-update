   (John 6:35; 6:51)


I am the bread of life
He who comes to Me
  will not hunger
I am the bread of life
And he who believes in Me
  will never thirst

I am the bread of life
He who comes to Me
  will not hunger
I am the bread of life
And he who believes in Me
  will never thirst

 ** *I am the living bread
  That came down out of heaven
  If anyone eats of this bread
  He will live forever***

 ** *I am the living bread
  That came down out of heaven
  If anyone eats of this bread
  He will live forever***

I am the bread of life
He who comes to Me
  will not hunger
I am the bread of life
And he who believes in Me
  will never thirst

I am the bread of life
He who comes to Me
  will not hunger
I am the bread of life
And he who believes in Me
  will never thirst

 ** *I am the living bread
  That came down out of heaven
  If anyone eats of this bread
  He will live forever***

 ** *I am the living bread
  That came down out of heaven
  If anyone eats of this bread
  He will live forever***

 ** *He will live forever***

I am the bread of life
