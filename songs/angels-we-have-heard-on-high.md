Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains

 ** *Gloria, in Excelsis Deo!
  Gloria, in Excelsis Deo!***

Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song?

 ** *Gloria, in Excelsis Deo!
  Gloria, in Excelsis Deo!***

Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing
Come, adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord, the newborn King

 ** *Gloria, in Excelsis Deo!
  Gloria, in Excelsis Deo!***
