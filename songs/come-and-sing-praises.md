<strong>(Psalm 29:1,2)</strong>
Ascribe to the Lord, O mighty ones
Ascribe to the Lord, glory and strength
Ascribe to the Lord, the glory due His name
Worship the Lord in the beauty of His holiness

Come and sing praises to the Rock of all Ages
Come and sing praises to Jesus our Lord
Come and adore Him, bow down before Him
Come and sing praises to Jesus our Lord
