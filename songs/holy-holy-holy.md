Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty
Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee
Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty
God in three persons, blessed Trinity

Holy, holy, holy! All the saints adore thee
Casting down their golden crowns
Around the glassy sea
Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee
Who wert, and art, and evermore shalt be

Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty
All Thy works shall praise Thy name
In earth and sky and sea
Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty
God in three persons, blessed Trinity
