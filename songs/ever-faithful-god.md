All glory to the King of ages
All glory to the King of kings
His name is love, His name is Jesus
Enthroned above in majesty

Into this world You came to save us
You bore the cross, You took my sin
You shone Your light into my darkness
Unveiled the truth, this mystery

You are my God, You are my Savior
You are the Rock on which I stand

Ever faithful God, I cling to You
In every way You've shown that You are good
There's no other love compares with You
Forever strong, forever true

Ever faithful God, I cling to You

You are the end of all my searching
You pour Your grace on all my need
Unfailing love, unending mercy
Are found in You, the Prince of peace

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

You are my God, You are my Savior
Eternal One, the Great I Am
