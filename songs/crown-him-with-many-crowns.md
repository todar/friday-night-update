Crown Him with many crowns
The Lamb upon His throne
Hark, how the heavenly anthem drowns
All music but its own
Awake, my soul, and sing
Of Him who died for thee
And hail Him as thy matchless King
Throughout eternity

Crown Him the Lord of life
Who triumphed o'er the grave
And rose victorious in the strife
For those He came to save
His glories now we sing
Who died and rose on high
Who died eternal life to bring
And lives that death may die

Crown Him the Lord of love
Behold His hands and side
Those wounds yet visible above
In beauty glorified
All hail, Redeemer, hail!
For Thou has died for me
Thy praise and glory shall not fail
Throughout eternity
