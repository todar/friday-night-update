We stand and lift up our hands
For the joy of the Lord is our strength
We bow down and worship Him now
How great, How awesome is He

And together we sing
Everyone sing

Holy is the Lord God Almighty!
The earth is filled with His Glory    <strong>[repeat]</strong>

It's rising up all around
It's the anthem of
The Lord's renown
