You were the Word at the beginning
One with God the Lord Most High
Your hidden glory in creation
Now revealed in You, our Christ

What a beautiful name it is    <strong>(2x)</strong>
The name of Jesus Christ, my King
What a beautiful name it is
Nothing compares to this
What a beautiful name it is
The name of Jesus

You didn't want heaven without us
So Jesus, You brought heaven down
My sin was great, Your love was greater
What could separate us now

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

Death could not hold You, the veil tore before You
You silenced the boast of sin and grave
The heavens are roaring, the praise of Your glory
For You are raised to life again

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

You have no rival, You have no equal
Now and forever, Our God reigns
Yours is the Kingdom, Yours is the glory
Yours is the Name, above all names

What a powerful name it is    <strong>(2x)</strong>
The name of Jesus Christ, my King
What a powerful name it is
Nothing can stand against
What a powerful name it is
The name of Jesus
