Praises to the Holy One
For the wonders You have done
Praise in every tribe and tongue
Jesus, to You be sung

Praise Him for His mighty power
Sun and moon and stars bow down
Praise in all creation now
Jesus, to You resounds

Let every voice, let every song
Let every instrument and sound
Declare the wonders of our God

Let all Your holy ones proclaim
The glory of our Savior's name
Let all the earth resound with praise
Jesus, to You

Angels help us to adore
As we bow our hearts in awe
Praise and honor evermore
Jesus, to You, our Lord

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

Let everything that lives and breathes
Let every mountain, every sea
Reflect the beauty of our God
Let every heart burst into song
Let every word upon my tongue
Declare the praise of who You are
