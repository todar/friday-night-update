Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

 ** *My chains are gone, I've been set free
  My God, My Savior has ransomed me
  And like a flood, His mercy reigns
  Unending love, amazing grace***

Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

When we've been there
Ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we'd first begun

 ** *My chains are gone, I've been set free
  My God, My Savior has ransomed me
  And like a flood, His mercy reigns
  Unending love, amazing grace***

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see
