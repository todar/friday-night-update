There is a name I love to hear
I love to sing its worth
It sounds like music in my ear
The sweetest name on earth

Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Because He first loved me

It tells me of a Savior's love
Who died to set me free
It tells me of His precious blood
The sinner's perfect plea

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

It bids my trembling heart rejoice
It dries each rising tear
It tells me, in a still small voice
To trust and never fear

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

And there with all the blood-bought throng
From sin and sorrow free
I'll sing the new eternal song
Of Jesus' love for me
