<strong>(Isaiah 6:8; Romans 10:13-14)</strong>
The Lord asked, "Whom shall I send
And who will go for Us?"
Then I said, "Here am I, send me."

For whoever will call on
The name of the Lord will be saved!
But how will they call on Him
In whom they have not believed?
And how will they believe in Him
Of whom they have not heard?
And how will they hear
If I am not willing to tell them?

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

The Lord asked, "Whom shall I send
And who will go for Us?"
So I say, "Here am I."
I say, "Here am I!"
Now I say, "Here am I, send me!"
