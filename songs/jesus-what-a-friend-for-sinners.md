Jesus! What a friend for sinners
Jesus, lover of my soul
Friends may fail me, foes assail me
He, my Savior, makes me whole

Hallelujah! What a Savior
Hallelujah! What a friend
Saving, helping, keeping, loving
He is with me to the end

Jesus! What a strength in weakness
Let me hide myself in Him
Tempted, tried, and sometimes failing
He, my strength, my victory wins

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

Jesus! What a loving shepherd
More than all in Him I find
He has granted me forgiveness
I am His and He is mine
