If faith can move the mountains
Let the mountains move
We come with expectation
Waiting here for You, waiting here for You

You're the Lord of all creation
And still You know my heart
The author of salvation
You've loved us from the start

Waiting here for You
With our hands lifted high in praise
And it's You we adore
Singing Alleluia

You are everything You've promised
Your faithfulness is true
And we're desperate for Your presence
All we need is You

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

We will wait for You, Lord
We will wait for You
We will sing Alleluia
Singing Alleluia, Alleluia    <strong>(2x)</strong>
