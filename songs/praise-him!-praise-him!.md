Praise Him! Praise Him!
Jesus, our blessed Redeemer
Sing, O earth, His wonderful love proclaim
Hail Him, hail Him, highest archangels in glory
Strength and honor give to His holy name
Like a shepherd, Jesus will guard His children
In His arms He carries them all day long

 ***Praise Him! Praise Him! 
   Tell of His excellent greatness
   Praise Him! Praise Him! 
   Ever in joyful song***

Praise Him! Praise Him!
Jesus, our blessed Redeemer
For our sins He suffered, and bled, and died
He, our Rock, our hope of eternal salvation
Hail Him! Hail Him! Jesus, the Crucified
Sound His praises, Jesus, who bore our sorrows
Love unbounded, wonderful, deep, and strong

 ***Praise Him! Praise Him! 
   Tell of His excellent greatness
   Praise Him! Praise Him! 
   Ever in joyful song***

Praise Him! Praise Him!
Jesus, our blessed Redeemer
Heav'nly portals loud with hosannas ring
Jesus, Savior, reigneth forever and ever
Crown Him, crown Him
Prophet and Priest and King
Christ is coming, over the world victorious
Pow'r and glory unto the Lord belong

 ***Praise Him! Praise Him! 
   Tell of His excellent greatness
   Praise Him! Praise Him! 
   Ever in joyful song***
