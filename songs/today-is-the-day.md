I'm casting my cares aside
I'm leaving my past behind
I'm setting my heart and mind on You, Jesus
I'm reaching my hand to Yours
Believing there's so much more
Knowing that all You have in store for me
Is good, is good

Today is the day You have made
I will rejoice and be glad in it
Today is the day You have made
I will rejoice and be glad in it
I won't worry about tomorrow
I'm trusting in what You say
Today is the day

I putting my fears aside
I'm leaving my doubts behind
I'm giving my hopes and dreams to You, Jesus
I'm reaching my hand to Yours
Believing there's so much more
Knowing that all You have in store for me
Is good, is good

<strong>[men lead, women echo]</strong>
I will stand upon Your truth
All my days I'll live for You   <strong>[repeat]</strong>
