<strong>(1 Timothy 1:17)</strong>
Immortal, You are not like a man
That you change Your mind
Or change Your plan
Invisible, our human eyes can't see
The depths of Your majesty

You're the God of forever and ever – Amen
The Alpha, Omega, beginning and end
We sing Hallelujah
We worship in awe
Immortal, invisible God

Immortal, You are not bound by death
You're the living God, my very breath
Invisible You are not bound by space
But Your glory is filling this place
Yes Your glory is filling this place

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

Immortal yet You once died for me
To pay my debt to set me free
Invisible You will not always be
Cause You're coming to reign as our King
And the saints will fall down at Your feet

<strong>(Chorus)</strong>

We sing Hallelujah
We worship in awe
Immortal, invisible God
Immortal, invisible God
