 **\    \[men]**
Men of faith, rise up and sing
Of the great and glorious King
You are strong when you feel weak
In your brokenness, complete

 ***Shout to the north and the south
  Sing to the east and the west
  Jesus is Savior to all
  Lord of heaven and earth***

 **\    \[women]**
Rise up women of the truth
Stand and sing to broken hearts
Who can know the healing power
Of our glorious King of love?

 ***Shout to the north and the south
  Sing to the east and the west
  Jesus is Savior to all
  Lord of heaven and earth***

We've been through fire
We've been through rain
We've been refined
By the power of His Name
We've fallen deeper in love with You
You've burned the truth on our lips

 ***Shout to the north and the south
  Sing to the east and the west
  Jesus is Savior to all
  Lord of heaven and earth***

 ***Shout to the north and the south
  Sing to the east and the west
  Jesus is Savior to all
  Lord of heaven and earth 
  Lord of heaven and earth 
  He's the Lord of heaven and earth***
