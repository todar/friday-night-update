I love to be in Your presence
With Your people singing praises
I love to stand and rejoice
Lift my hands and raise my voice

You set my feet to dancing
You fill my heart with song
You give me reason to rejoice

<strong>[last time]</strong>
I love to be in Your presence
With Your people singing praises
I love to stand and rejoice
Lift my hands
Lift my hands
Lift my hands
And raise my voice
