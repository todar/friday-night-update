Come to Jesus, all you who labor
you're carrying such a great load
Take His gentle yoke upon you
and you will find rest for your soul

 ***He is the way, the truth, the life
     and the resurrection
   He has prepared a place for me
   When I go to be with Him
     I will finally be home
   and I will live with Him eternally***

O death, where is your victory? 
O death, where is your sting?
For my Lord Jesus has won the victory
and He waits to welcome me

 ***He is the way, the truth, the life
     and the resurrection
   He has prepared a place for me
   When I go to be with Him
     I will finally be home
   and I will live with Him eternally***

This life is brief, just a vapor
a place where I get to choose
to trade my sin for His righteousness
giving my life, I have nothing to lose

 ***He is the way, the truth, the life
     and the resurrection
   He has prepared a place for me
   When I go to be with Him
     I will finally be home
   and I will live with Him eternally***

 ***He is the way, the truth, the life
     and the resurrection
   He has prepared a place for me
   When I go to be with Him
     I will finally be home
   and I will live with Him eternally***

 ***And I will live with Him eternally***
