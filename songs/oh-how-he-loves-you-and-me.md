Oh, how He loves you and me
Oh, how He loves you and me
He gave His life, what more could He give?
Oh, how He loves you, Oh, how He loves me
Oh, how He loves you and me

Jesus to Calv'ry did go
His love for mankind to show
What He did there brought hope from despair
Oh, how He loves you, Oh, how He loves me
Oh, how He loves you and me
