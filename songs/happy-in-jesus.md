Found by Jesus 
I'm no longer lost 
He paid my debt
 by His death on that cross
I’m happy in Jesus 
There’s no one beside 
He’s the light and the truth
He’s the way to eternal life 

Present with Jesus
All fears bow below
Our King who reigns
 from His heavenly throne
I’m happy in Jesus 
I lay down my head
In the morning I’ll wake
 and take from my daily bread 

Loved by Jesus
What more could I need?
Whom He sets free
 is free indeed
I’m happy in Jesus
He’s always enough
My life has been made
 and is changed by His faithful love

Yes, I'm happy in Jesus 
I'm never alone 
And I'll follow my Savior forever
 wherever He goes
