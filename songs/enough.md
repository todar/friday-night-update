 ** *All of You
  Is more than enough for all of me
  For every thirst and every need
  You satisfy me with Your love
  And all I have in You
  Is more than enough***

You're my supply
My breath of life
Still more awesome than I know
You're my reward
Worth living for
Still more awesome than I know

 ** *All of You
  Is more than enough for all of me
  For every thirst and every need
  You satisfy me with Your love
  And all I have in You
  Is more than enough***

You're my sacrifice
Of greatest price
Still more awesome than I know
You're my coming King
You are everything
Still more awesome than I know

 ** *All of You
  Is more than enough for all of me
  For every thirst and every need
  You satisfy me with Your love
  And all I have in You
  Is more than enough***

More than all I want
More than all I need
You are more than enough for me
More than all I know
More than all I can say
You are more than enough

 ** *All of You
  Is more than enough for all of me
  For every thirst and every need
  You satisfy me with Your love
  And all I have in You
  Is more than enough***
