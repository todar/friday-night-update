It's not just about the manger, where the baby lay
It's not all about the angels, who sang for Him that day
It's not all about the shepherds, or the bright and shining star
It's not all about the wise men, who travelled from afar

It's about the cross, it's about my sin
It's about how Jesus came to be born once
So that we could be born again

It's about the stone, that was rolled away
So that you and I could have real life today
It's about the cross

It's not just about the good things, in this life I've done
It's not all about the treasures, or the trophies that I've won
It's not about the righteousness, that I find within
It's all about His precious blood, that saved me from my sin

The beginning of the story is wonderful and great
But it's the ending that can save you
And that's why we celebrate

It's about the cross, it's about my sin
It's about how Jesus came to be born once
So that we could be born again

It's about God's Son, nailed to a tree
It's about how every drop of blood that flowed
From Him when it should've been me

It's about the stone, that was rolled away
So that you and I could have real life today    <strong>(2x)</strong>

It's about the cross
