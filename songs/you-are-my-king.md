  You are my King
  You are the Lord of hosts
  Only in your name
  Do I find hope

  You are my King
  You are the Word made flesh 
  Only in Your will
  Do I find rest

In the storm and the pain
Through it all You remain
King of kings and Lord of lords
You shall reign forevermore

  You are my King
  You are the Lord of hosts
  Only in your name
  Do I find hope

  You are my King
  You are the Word made flesh 
  Only in Your will
  Do I find rest

From the scorn and the shame
Even death, You overcame
Age to age on Your throne
One day Iâ€™ll know as I am known

Oh Lord, hear your servant cry
Please do not hide your face from me
Oh Lord, in the hour of my distress
Patiently I bless Your holy name!

  You are my King
  You are the Lord of hosts
  Only in your name
  Do I find hope

  You are my King
  You are the Word made flesh 
  Only in Your will
  Do I find rest

You are my king
