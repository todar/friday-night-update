Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best thought, by day or by night
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence, my light

Be Thou my wisdom, be Thou my true Word
I ever with Thee, and Thou with me, Lord
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee, one

Be Thou my shield and my sword for the fight
Be Thou my dignity, be Thou my might
Thou my soul's shelter, Thou my high tower
Raise Thou me heavenward, O Power of my power

Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise
Thou mine inheritance, now and always
Thou and Thou only, be first in my heart
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art

High King of heaven, my victory won
May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's Son
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall
Still be my vision, O Ruler of all
