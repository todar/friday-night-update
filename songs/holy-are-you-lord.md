Glory that no eye has seen
The praise of all eternity
You are
Brighter shining than the sun
Far beyond this race we run
You are

  You are more than any words can ever say
  You are!
  For all time, Jesus
  Your Name, Your praise
  Shall be my song

 ***You are holy, holy
  Holy are you Lord
  You are holy, holy
  Holy are you Lord***

Heaven's everlasting song
The One who was, and is to come
You are
More than diamonds more than gold
You are fire to my soul
You are

  You are more than any words can ever say
  You are!
  For all time, Jesus
  Your Name, Your praise
  Shall be my song

 ***You are holy, holy
  Holy are you Lord
  You are holy, holy
  Holy are you Lord***

 ***You are holy, holy
  Holy are you Lord
  You are holy, holy
  Holy are you Lord***

How can I be stood before
One as holy as You are?
Hallelujah for the cross
Live inside of me and sanctify my heart

 ***You are holy, holy
  Holy are you Lord
  You are holy, holy
  Holy are you Lord***

 ***You are holy, holy
  Holy are you Lord
  You are holy, holy
  Holy are you Lord***
