Mary, did you know that your baby boy
 would one day walk on water?
Mary did you know that your baby boy
 would save our sons and daughters?
Did you know that your baby boy
 has come to make us new?
This Child that you delivered
 will soon deliver you

Mary, did you know that your baby boy
 will give sight to the blind man?
Mary, did you know that your baby boy
 would calm a storm with His hand?
Did you know that your baby boy
 has walked where angels trod?
And when you kiss your little baby
 you’ve kissed the face of God

   The blind will see, the deaf will hear
   The dead will live again
   The lame will leap, the dumb will speak
   The praises of the Lamb!

Mary, did you know that your baby boy
 is Lord of all creation?
Mary, did you know that your baby boy
 will one day rule the nations?
Did you know that your baby boy
 was heaven’s perfect Lamb?
This sleeping Child you’re holding
 is the great I AM!
