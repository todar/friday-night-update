Mary, did you know
That your baby boy
Would one day walk on water?
Mary did you know
That your baby boy
Would save our sons and daughters?
Did you know
That your baby boy, has come to make us new
This Child that you delivered
Will soon deliver you?

Mary, did you know
That your baby boy
Will give sight to the blind man?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy
Would calm a storm with His hand?
Did you know
That your baby boy, has walked where angels trod
And when you kiss your little baby
You've kissed the face of God?

The blind will see, the deaf will hear
The dead will live again
The lame will leap, the dumb will speak
The praises of the Lamb!

Mary, did you know
That your baby boy
Is Lord of all creation?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy
Will one day rule the nations?
Did you know
That your baby boy, was heaven's perfect Lamb
And this sleeping Child you're holding
Is the great I AM!
