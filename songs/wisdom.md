 **\    (Proverbs 3:13-16)**


How blessed is the man who finds wisdom
And the man who gains understanding
For her profit is better than the profit of silver
And her gain than fine gold

She is more precious than jewels
And nothing you desire compares with her
Long life is in her right hand
In her left hand are riches and honor

<strong>\[last time]</strong>
And her gain is much better than fine gold
